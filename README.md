# SusAInData

## Problem Definition
In a world where digital demand is surging, data centers face an unprecedented challenge: to scale sustainably while cutting their carbon footprint. Our project redefines data center decarbonization by delivering end-to-end solutions that streamline renewable energy integration, maximize energy efficiency, and offer real-time carbon tracking. We empower data centers to meet rigorous ESG goals, reduce operational costs, and stay resilient in the face of changing regulations. With our modular and flexible approach, we enable companies to build data centers that are not only future-ready but also a step closer to a carbon-neutral future.
